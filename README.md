🎬 CinemaScopeAI – AI-Powered Movie Recommendation System
CinemaScopeAI is a full-stack, production-ready AI movie recommendation platform that leverages deep learning and scalable backend infrastructure. It combines a powerful Python-based FastAPI backend with a Swift-based iOS frontend. Built with Clean Architecture principles, this project is modular, testable, and cloud-deployable via Docker and AWS ECS.

How It Works
The system uses collaborative filtering and content-based techniques to recommend movies based on user behavior and content similarity.

Architecture Overview:

Xcode App (SwiftUI) 
       ↓ REST API
FastAPI (Python) 
       ↓ PyTorch
DL Recommendation Model

🧪 Features
🔍 Smart Recommendations – Based on vector embeddings and metadata.

🌐 API-Driven – Clean, documented RESTful endpoints.

🧪 Unit & Integration Tests – For both backend and frontend.

⚙️ CI/CD Ready – GitHub Actions + Docker + Render/AWS ECS.

💾 Custom Model Training – Scripted via train.py & inference.py.

Frontend (iOS)
Open CinemaScopeAI.xcodeproj

Update base URL in CinemaScopeAIService.swift

Build & run the app in the simulator

Deployment
Docker
# Build Docker image
docker build -t cinemascope-recsys .

# Run locally
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 cinemascope-recsys
AWS ECS (Fargate)
Push image to Amazon ECR

Use ECS CLI or Console to deploy to Fargate

Auto-scales and publicly available endpoint

⚡ Render (Easy Alternative)
Create a new Web Service

Connect GitHub repo

Set uvicorn api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 as start command

Done 🎉

✅ To Do
Backend API endpoints

Xcode frontend integration

Torch model training/inference

Docker containerization

GitHub Actions (CI)

Add Swagger custom docs

Expand to TV show recommendations
