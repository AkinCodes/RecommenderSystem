# üé¨ CinemaScopeAI ‚Äì AI-Powered Movie Recommendation System

CinemaScopeAI is a **full-stack, production-ready AI movie recommendation platform** that leverages deep learning and scalable backend infrastructure. It combines a powerful **Python-based FastAPI backend** with a **Swift-based iOS frontend**. Built using **Clean Architecture** principles, this project is modular, testable, and cloud-deployable via **Docker** and **Render**.

As a bonus, the app includes a GPT-powered natural language recommender, allowing users to type freeform prompts like ‚Äúmind-bending sci-fi thrillers with a twist‚Äù and receive smart, tailored movie suggestions using the OpenAI API.

## How It Works
The system uses **collaborative filtering** and **content-based techniques** to recommend movies based on user behavior and content similarity.

### Architecture Overview

## Tech Stack

### Backend (FastAPI)
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- Uvicorn + Gunicorn
- Dockerized + Deployable to AWS ECR/ECS or Render

### Frontend (iOS)
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- MVVM
- URLSession networking
- Async API calls to deployed FastAPI

---

## Features
- **Smart Recommendations** ‚Äì Based on vector embeddings and metadata.
- **API-Driven** ‚Äì Clean, documented RESTful endpoints.
- **Unit & Integration Tests** ‚Äì For both backend and frontend.
- **CI/CD Ready** ‚Äì GitHub Actions + Docker + Render/AWS ECS.
- **Custom Model Training** ‚Äì Scripted via `train.py` & `inference.py`.

---

## Dataset
This project leverages the [`netflix_titles.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) dataset, sourced from Kaggle. It contains metadata about Netflix content, including **titles, directors, genres, cast, release years, and descriptions**.

While the deployed recommendation engine uses **real-time data from TMDB**, this dataset was vital during experimentation and model development:

- Cold-start simulations
- Embedding training
- Initial data preprocessing & pipeline validation

It laid the groundwork for learning before switching to live TMDB-fetching in production.

## Running Locally

### Backend (FastAPI)
```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtualenv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the server
uvicorn api.app:app --reload
```

### üì± Frontend (iOS)
- Open `CinemaScopeAI.xcodeproj` in Xcode
- In `CinemaScopeAIService.swift`, set:
  ```swift
  let baseURL = "https://cinemascope-api.onrender.com"
  ```
- Build & run on iOS Simulator (iOS 16+)
- GitHub iOS Frontend Repo: [CinemaScopeAI (Frontend)](https://github.com/AkinCodes/CinemaScopeAI)

## Training the Model & Visualizing with TensorBoard

CinemaScopeAI includes a **custom training pipeline** powered by **PyTorch Lightning**, with **TensorBoard** support built in for real-time training visualization and performance insights.

---

### Step 1: Train the Model

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the training script
python scripts/train.py
```

This will:

- Train the DLRM-based recommendation model  
- Log training & validation loss to `lightning_logs/`  
- Save model checkpoints for future inference  

---

### Step 2: Launch TensorBoard

```bash
tensorboard --logdir lightning_logs
```

Then open the URL shown in your terminal ‚Äî typically:

- [`http://localhost:6006`](http://localhost:6006)  
- Or something like [`http://localhost:6008`](http://localhost:6008) if 6006 is in use  

You‚Äôll be able to:

- Visualize **training & validation loss curves**
- Explore **epoch-by-epoch scalar metrics**
- Monitor how your model is learning in real time

### Pro Tip: Keep It Clean

All logs and checkpoints are excluded from Git via `.gitignore`.  
You can regenerate them anytime by re-running the training script above.

### Netflix SQL Analysis: Country vs Content Type Breakdown

As part of exploring my SQL and data visualization skills, I performed a detailed analysis using **SQLite + Pandas** to uncover how Netflix content varies across countries.

### üîç Objective
**Which countries have the most Netflix content, and what's the breakdown between Movies and TV Shows in those countries?**

### SQL Query (SQLite)
```sql
SELECT 
    country,
    type,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM netflix_titles
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY country, type
HAVING country IN (
    SELECT country
    FROM netflix_titles
    WHERE country IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY country
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
ORDER BY country, type;
```

### üìà Visualization
Using `matplotlib`, I transformed the result into a **stacked bar chart**, showing the split between **TV Shows** and **Movies** per country:

<br><br>

**Bonus: Epic Stacked Bar Plot** ‚Äî Built using Pandas' pivot + Matplotlib for clean, readable comparison across countries.
